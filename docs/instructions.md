# **Instructions**

## **Download gradebook**

1. Go to the course page on Blackboard

2. Go to *Grade Centre -> Full Grade Centre*

3. Find the assignment and click on the arrow for more options, and select *Assignment File Download*

4. Select all (click *Show All* at the bottom first, to display all users) and click submit to generate the gradebook zip file

5. Wait for the generated download link to appear, and click to download

## **Extract gradebook**

Extract the downloaded gradebook in a new directory inside *BB_gradebooks*.

- e.g. for `AssignmentX` extract the gradebook in *BB_gradebooks*/`AssignmentX`

## **Organise gradebook**

Before running the script for the first time, install the required packages (*py7z*, *rarfile*):

```python
python -m pip install py7zr rarfile
```

Note: If running on Linux/Mac, you also need to have `unrar` installed in order to be able to extract *.rar* files.

- `sudo apt install unrar` for Linux

- `brew install rar` for Mac

&nbsp;  
To organise the gradebook run **`organise_gradebook.py`** and provide the name of the directory with the *extracted* gradebook (from section *Extract gradebook* above) as an argument.

- e.g. for gradebook `AssignmentX` (in *BB_gradebooks*/`AssignmentX`) run:

```python
python organise_gradebook.py AssignmentX
```

While running, the script displays on the terminal information and stats about the gradebook submissions and files.

## **Post-run**

All submission files can be found - organised in directories per student number - in directory *BB_submissions*, under the sub-directory named after the gradebook name provided when running the script.

- e.g. `organise_gradebook.py AssignmentX` creates the directory `AssignmentX` inside *BB_submissions*

Each student directory contains:

- the extracted files from the submitted `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`
  
- the individually submitted files
  
- the text file generated by Blackboard for the submission (which also contains any comments left by the student)

All comments found in the gradebook are extracted in a text file in *BB_submissions*, with the gradebook name as prefix.

- e.g. `AssignmentX_comments.txt` will be created for gradebook `AssignmentX`

Compressed files are deleted after successfully extracting and organising the contents.

- Any invalid/corrupt compressed files are moved into folder `__BAD__` inside the gradebook directory
